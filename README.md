# Deploy your own Crowdfunding DApp
The new millennia are all about social living and sharing economy; from homestays, hotels, cars and product development; social development, community creation and crowdfunding is part and parcel of our daily lives. ‘Crowdfunding’ as a channel for product development and for generating promising sales which has been used for more than a decade a now. Our goal is to move these channels to web3 space. We will be creating a crowdfunding campaign through a smart contract with objective of raising funds through the decentralized web3 world.  

What are we going to learn?
1.	Nuances of a crowdfunding smart contract. 
2.	Deploy the smart contract 
3.	Create a campaign over an online web3 platform 
4.	Funding a campaign 
5.	Withdrawal of funds collected in a campaign 


# Pre-requisites

1. Have access to internet with unblocked access. 
2. Browser - any one among MS Edge, Chrome, Brave. 
3. Install Metamask wallet : https://metamask.io/

# Steps

## Crowdfunding smart contract 

Refer [useful links](#useful-links-to-be-used-in-the-session) to find the correct link to the crowdfunding smart contract which is opened in Ethereum remix online IDE.

## How to transfer testnet Build Bear tokens

1. Connect metamask wallet to Build Bear testnet faucet as mentioned in the [useful links](#useful-links-to-be-used-in-the-session)

## Smart contract 

Open the source code in Ethereum remix online web3 editor as mentioned in the [useful links](#useful-links-to-be-used-in-the-session). It will look like below screenshot.

Annotated #1 represents the source code pane in which source code can be edited and worked on.

#2 is the place where we can compile the smart contract.

#3 is where we will be deploying the smart contract and will be used for testing the deployed contract.

More details will be shared during the session.
